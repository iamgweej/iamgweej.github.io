Hello there. I dont know how you got here, but I guess somewhere along the line you've made a pretty terrible mistake.

My name is Alon Ben-Tsur, and I like to develop _stuff_. The _stuff_ usually doesn't work and may end up BSODing your computer.

You have been warned.

In this blog you will probably find:
* `-nostdlib` development for fun and profit.
* Windows user mode and kernel mode adventures.
* Functional programming galore.
* Mathematics nonsense.
* Hand to hand combat with compilers and interpreters.
* General knowledge about marine mammels.
